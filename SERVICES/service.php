                    <strong>It’s one thing to get a job done right. It’s another to get it done right with time and cost efficiencies. That’s the basic premise behind Lean Construction, and it’s integral to how we manage our projects.</strong>
           </p> 
           <p><strong>We start by mapping out every step of the project—</strong>eliminating redundancies, overlaps, and potential miscommunications. We bring all trades to the table, empowering and leveraging each of the subcontractors’ experience to create a shared goal and commitment. The result? Better planning. Better communication. A lot less wasted time and money.</p>
            <p><strong>Lean isn’t just for the field—</strong>we implement Lean practices in our offices, too. The efficiencies in our operations, purchasing, and accounting translates into greater efficiencies and real value for our clients, with up to 20% time shaved off your schedule.</p>

                    <strong>The American Institute of Architects defines IPD as</strong>“an approach that integrates people, systems, business structures, and practices into a process that collaboratively harnesses the talents and insights of all participants to optimize project results, increase value to the owner, reduce waste and maximize efficiency through all phases of design, fabrication, and construction.”<br><br>
           <strong>IPD removes uncertainty and leverages the experience, talent, and input of all team members.</strong> That, in turn, improves the construction process, minimizes cost, and maximizes the value to you, the client. Because great things happen when we all come together.</p>

            <li>We’re fans of precommissioning. Some CMs don’t offer it. Some clients don’t want it. We think it’s not only a great customer service, it’s a great way to make sure there are absolutely no surprises.</li>
